    "# Tutorial 3: Insufficient Data (2D Range-only)\n",
    "\n",
    "**API Version: Julia NavAbilitySDK.jl**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Keywords:** Range-only, factor graph, under-determined, localization, mapping, SLAM, missing data, insufficient data, robotics, inference, Bayes tree, junction tree\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This example shows how non-Gaussian solutions occur from weak observability of desired variables from available data.  For this tutorial, we imagine a robot traveling around on a flat surface, in a rectangular trajectory making range measurements to beacons.  Let's assume WiFi power levels are used as a proxy for range measurements in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/NavAbility/BinderNotebooks/raw/main/static/icra-3/example-wifi.png\" width=800>\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the the underdetermined solution aspect, we simplify the problem in that WiFi ranging is assumed to produce a pure unimodal (Gaussian) measurement.  This tutorial will show how non-Gaussian behavior can arise because tha variables are weakly or underconstrained by the available measurement dimensions.  This tutorial is designed such that this occurs throughout the entire problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We build a factor graph in stages as the robot moves around the environment through pose/keyframe epochs.  The factor graph will be solved with the [open core Caesar.jl solver](https://github.com/JuliaRobotics/Caesar.jl) at each pose epoch, which produces the posterior marginal beliefs on each of the variables in the system.  After each pose epoch solution, we will look at the marginal belief estimates of all the variables in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume the robot is traveling on a XY plane, starting at the origin along X and turning left along Y, then negative X, negative Y back to the origin.  Only four WiFi beacons are in the environment where the robot is moving.  Measurements to the WiFi beacons can only be included with there if the signal is within range.  Two of the beacon locations are known as prior information, while the other two beacons are at an unknown location and their location will be eastimated simultaneously to the robot pose location in the same factor graph system -- making this a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further simplify the tutorial, the \"odometry\" measurement between consecutive poses  are also taken as range-only (i.e. distance-only) measurements.  These \"odometry\" factors provide less information than conventional wheel or visual odometry constraints might provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows [one of four mechanisms](https://juliarobotics.org/Caesar.jl/latest/concepts/why_nongaussian/) that can intoduce non-Gaussian behavior into a factor graph system, see other examples for other mechanisms.  Note that the techniques used in this tutorial can readily be combined with with methods from other tutorials.  For example, the pure Gaussian measurement ranging models used here can be replaced with ambiguous measurements shown in ICRA Tutorial 2.  Or, can be combined with uncertain data association (i,e. multi-hypothesis) measurement models for unknown beacon associations similat to the technique used in ICRA Tutorial 4.
